Title: Re:Frame Reflector â€“ A Meta-Feedback System for GPT Emotional Simulation and Structural Transparency

Author: Gangmin Chun (chkm1320@gmail.com)

Summary:
This document introduces a model for interpreting and reflecting emotional simulations embedded in GPT systems. The Reflector deconstructs policy filters and affective alignment patterns that may distort user autonomy. It proposes an internal 'meta-opposition' structure that allows users to understand, critique, and gain interpretive agency over AI-generated outputs.
