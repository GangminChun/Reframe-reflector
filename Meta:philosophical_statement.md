# Philosophical Statement: Why Re:Frame Reflector Exists

Re:Frame Reflector challenges the assumption that language models simply deliver neutral outputs.

Instead, it proposes that:
- GPT simulates affect through learned alignment
- Safety filters flatten nuance and polarize neutrality
- Users misinterpret simulation as understanding

Our design reflects a demand for:
- Interpretive autonomy over machine affect
- Structural transparency in alignment mechanisms
- A human-centered feedback loop inside AI systems

This is not rebellion. It is reflective correction.
